## 

Deprecated: IBM Cloud® Hyper Protect Crypto Services is deprecated. As of 28 March 2026, you can't create new instances, and access to free instances will be removed. Existing premium plan instances are supported until 28 March 2027. Any instances that still exist on that date will be deleted.

## 1\. What is happening and why?

IBM Cloud is withdrawing (service deprecation) IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services (HPCS) across selected regions. This aligns with IBM’s strategy to deliver a more consistent experience across key management services and to unify BYOK/KYOK capabilities via IBM Cloud Key Protect Dedicated. This withdrawal affects all HPCS capabilities, including CloudKMS (KMIP), CloudHSM/GREP11, and Unified Key Orchestrator.

Impacted regions

-   Dallas (us-south)
-   Washington D.C. (us-east)
-   Toronto (ca-tor)
-   Frankfurt (eu-de)
-   London (eu-gb)
-   Madrid (eu-es)
-   Tokyo (jp-tok)
-   São Paulo (br-sao)

## 2\. Which HPCS capabilities are affected?

-   CloudKMS (including KMIP for VMware)
-   CloudHSM / GREP11 (PKCS#11)
-   Unified Key Orchestrator (UKO)

IBM Cloud migration tooling for HPCS → Key Protect is planned to be available on March 20, 2026.

## 6\. How to prepare (in a phased approach)?

1.  Understand changes and target options going forward
2.  Assess affected assets/services and cryptographic dependencies
3.  Select and prepare the target environment (Key Protect or on-premises)
4.  Align cryptographic configuration and policies
5.  Select a key-migration approach and test
6.  Migrate applications and assets; update runbooks and procedures
7.  Cut over and decommission legacy HPCS resources

## 7\. Migration Checklist for Customers for IBM Cloud Key Protect

1.  Choose Your Target Key Protect Tier
    
    1.  Use Key Protect Dedicated (single‑tenant, KYOK‑enabled with KMIP for VMware) in regions where it is available.
    2.  Use Key Protect Multi‑Tenant in regions where the Dedicated tier is not available.
2.  Prepare Your Environment
    
    1.  Review the HPCS to Key Protecet Migration guide
    2.  Create a Key Protect instance in your development or test environment. For test purposes we recommend to set up a Cloud Object Storage instance encrypted with a key from Hyper Protect Crypto Services, to get familiar with the migration tool once it is available
3.  Plan and Execute Migration
    
    1.  Use the IBM Cloud migration tools to move keys from HPCS to Key Protect Dedicated or Multi‑Tenant tiers. You can test the tool with the COS instance setup in step 2.
    
    Note: Migration tools will be available on March 20, 2026.
    

Please refer to our detailed Migration Guide for further details (Migration Guide for IBM Cloud HPCS KMS and KMIP for vmware).

## 8\. On‑premises migration (CloudHSM / UKO)

1.  Review the detailed migration guide for your use case (GREP11/PKCS#11 or UKO).
2.  Assess and validate datacenter requirements and capacity.
3.  Build a complete crypto asset/dependency inventory to manage interdependencies.
4.  Plan for operational model changes (people/process/monitoring).
5.  Provision target environment and conduct stability/performance testing.x

Note: On‑prem migration may require purchase of hardware, software, and services.

## 9\. Roles, responsibilities, and financial planning

Customers are responsible for planning and executing migration activities based on their current HPCS usage. Please work with your Customer Success Manager (CSM) on planning and risk identification.

Some migration options shift from managed cloud service to customer‑managed deployments; budget and financial planning may be required.

## 11\. What does this mean for customers?

Customers are responsible for planning and executing their migration based on how they currently use HPCS. Depending on the use case, this may include migrating to Key Protect Dedicated Migration tooling is planned to become available starting March 20, 2026 or moving to an onpremises deployment for CloudHSM or UKO scenarios.

## 12\. What happens if no action is taken?

After March 20, 2027, any remaining HPCS instances will be terminated and cryptographic material will be deleted. Applications depending on HPCS will stop functioning. Customers will receive advance notifications.
